1. What is the difference between truncate, delete, drop?

Delete
It is DDL cmd
can either delete all the rows in one go or can delete rows one by one. 
Slower than truncate cmd
We can use rollback command but auto commit should set to be manual

Drop
It is  DDL cmd
It can drop whole structure with data means existence of whole table with data is vanished
We cant use rollback cmd because it is auto commit

It removes all row but the structure of the table remains 
We cant use rollback command
Faster than delete cmd
